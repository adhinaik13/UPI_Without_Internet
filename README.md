&gt; **Offline peer-to-peer payments with cryptographic settlement.**
&gt;
&gt; Two devices with zero network connectivity can exchange payment information through encrypted QR codes. When a device or bridge regains connectivity, the transaction can be forwarded to the backend settlement gateway for verification and idempotent processing.

&gt; ⚠️ **Current Status:** This repository implements the **backend settlement gateway**, **QR-code payment simulation**, and **server-side mesh/store-and-forward simulation**. Native Bluetooth LE / WiFi Direct transport and Android integration are planned future work.

🔐 Security Model

**1. Hybrid Encryption**
The payment payload uses a hybrid encryption approach:

Payment Payload
      │
      ▼
AES-256-GCM
      │
      ▼
Encrypted Payload
      │
      +
      │
RSA-OAEP
      │
      ▼
Protected AES Key

AES-256-GCM provides:

• Confidentiality
• Authenticated encryption
• Tamper detection
RSA-OAEP is used for protecting the symmetric encryption key rather than encrypting the entire payment payload directly. This combines the efficiency of symmetric encryption with asymmetric key protection.

**2. Transaction Fingerprinting**
Transactions use a SHA-256 based fingerprint for identifying duplicate transaction submissions.

Transaction Data
       │
       ▼
    SHA-256
       │
       ▼
Transaction Fingerprint

The fingerprint is used during the idempotency/duplicate-processing flow.

**3. Idempotent Settlement**
The system is designed to prevent the same transaction from being settled multiple times when duplicate bridge deliveries occur.

Bridge A ─────┐
              │
Bridge B ─────┼────► Settlement Gateway
              │
Bridge C ─────┘
                       │
                       ▼
                 Idempotency Check
                       │
              ┌────────┴────────┐
              ▼                 ▼
          First Claim        Duplicate
              │                 │
              ▼                 ▼
           Settle             Reject

This is particularly important in a store-and-forward system where the same transaction may reach the settlement gateway through multiple paths.

**4. Transaction Freshness**
The system uses transaction freshness validation to reject stale payment payloads. The exact freshness/replay guarantees depend on the current implementation and are intentionally kept within the scope of this prototype.

**5. Hardware Security Roadmap**
Future Android integration can use hardware-backed key storage such as:

• Android StrongBox
• Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

This is planned future work, not part of the current backend implementation.

### **6. Digital Signatures (Sender Authentication)**

Each device generates its own 2048-bit RSA keypair. The private key never leaves the device. The public key is registered with the settlement gateway and linked to the device's VPA.

```text
Payment Instruction (canonical)
       │
       ▼
   RSA-PSS Sign
   (device private key)
       │

🌐 **Mesh / Store-and-Forward Model**

The current project simulates the behavior of disconnected bridge nodes on the backend.
A simplified propagation flow is:

Node A
  │
  ▼
Node B
  │
  ├────────► Node C
  │
  ▼
Node D
  │
  │ Internet restored
  ▼
Settlement Gateway

A bridge can temporarily retain a transaction and forward it when connectivity becomes available.
**Important scope:** The current repository does not implement native Bluetooth LE or WiFi Direct communication. Instead, the backend models the transaction propagation and settlement behavior that such a transport layer could use.

🧪 **Testing**
Run the test suite with:

Linux / macOS
./mvnw test

Windows
mvnw.cmd test

Current tests cover areas including:

• Encryption/decryption round-trip
• Tampered ciphertext rejection
• Duplicate transaction handling
• Concurrent duplicate ingestion
• Idempotent settlement behavior
• Replay attack defense (same packet submitted twice)

Concurrency Scenario
The project includes a concurrency test that simulates multiple delivery attempts for the same transaction.

             Same Transaction
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        ▼           ▼           ▼
     Thread 1    Thread 2    Thread 3
        │           │           │
        └───────────┼───────────┘
                    ▼
             Idempotency Check
                    │
          ┌─────────┴─────────┐
          ▼                   ▼
       SETTLED             DUPLICATE

The purpose is to verify that concurrent duplicate delivery does not result in multiple settlements.

🔎 **Observability**

The application includes a web dashboard for viewing transaction activity during development and demonstrations.
The dashboard helps visualize:

• Accounts
• Transactions
• Settlement status
• Transaction flow

This is intended primarily for development, testing, and demonstration.

⚠️ **Limitations**
This project is a research/educational prototype and is not a production UPI implementation.
Current limitations include:

• No direct integration with NPCI or real bank settlement rails
• No real bank accounts or monetary transfers
• Native Bluetooth LE transport is not implemented
• Native WiFi Direct transport is not implemented
• Mesh networking is currently simulated server-side
• H2 is used for local development
• Identity and key provisioning are simplified
• Android hardware-backed key storage is not yet integrated
• The cryptographic protocol has not undergone formal security certification
• Production-grade deployment infrastructure is outside the current scope

These limitations are intentional and define the current prototype boundary.

The project separates API controllers, cryptographic components, domain models, services, and configuration to keep the backend modular.

📋 **Example Transaction Lifecycle**

• Sender creates payment
• Payment payload is encrypted
• Encrypted payload is encoded into QR
• Transaction can be exchanged offline
• Bridge/store-and-forward layer retains transaction
• Connectivity becomes available
• Bridge submits transaction to gateway
• Gateway decrypts and validates transaction
• Transaction fingerprint is checked
• Duplicate transactions are rejected
• Valid transaction is settled
• Transaction is recorded in the ledger

🎯 **Interview Pitch**

"I built a prototype for offline peer-to-peer payments using encrypted QR codes and a store-and-forward mesh model. The backend is implemented with Java and Spring Boot. Payment payloads use RSA-OAEP and AES-256-GCM hybrid encryption, RSA-PSS digital signatures for sender authentication, and SHA-256 transaction fingerprints with atomic idempotency handling to prevent duplicate settlement when the same transaction reaches the gateway through multiple paths. I also implemented QR generation, a server-side mesh simulation, REST APIs, Swagger documentation, automated tests, Docker support, and GitHub Actions CI."
